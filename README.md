# Mancala-Java-Project
End of term project programming user vs. computer Mancala game.

Used Dr. Java IDE
Works as a game to play within the IDE

//Updates to make:
-Game does not play as Mancala is traditionally played. Players are only allowed to go to the end of their row at the moment. Should be allowed to move along both sides of boards adding and removing tokens as they go.

-Computer is dumb, making random movements and selections after player turn. Almost impossible for player to not win. Add some sort of learning element to make more difficult.

-Could eventually add gui instead of making player use IDE as interface.
//

Game starts with player making move and computer responding with random movement choice until one side of the board is completely empty of tokens. Whoever has most tokens in end board "cup" wins the game. 

High Scores list is kept and checked against at the end of each game with a select sort entering user in list if high score is achieved.
